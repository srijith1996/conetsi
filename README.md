# COnstrained NEtwork State Information
### Mechanism for collecting Network state information through opportunistic exploration

This repository contains a Contiki-ng implementation of conetsi, an application level, network state information (NSI) collecting mechanism for resource constrained devices.  The core algorithm uses a custom exploration and information gathering engine to collect vital network statistics, while adhering to time and space constraints.  A detailed description of the algorithm and its analysis is published in, [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9027403).
